# ThetaCGL: an isogeny-based hash-function

Code accompanying the research paper: [Radical 2-isogenies in theta coordinates and applications to cryptographic hash functions in dimensions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1732) by Sabrina Kunzweiler, Luciano Maino, Tomoki Moriya, Christophe Petit, Giacomo Pope, Damien Robert, Miha Stopar and Yan Bo Ti.

This repository includes code which implements the ThetaCGL hash function described in the above paper in both Rust and SageMath. For more information about each implementation, see the README.md files in the corresponding directories `theta_cgl_py` and `theta_cgl_rust`.

Additional symbolic proofs of statements made in the paper are contained in `verifications`.
